The objective is to create a shared worker that allows multiple tabs to view and edit the same document. 


every move can be construed as a cut/paste
inserts can be appends + cut/paste

is that a more fundamental operation then?
what about discontinuous selection

fail and rebase? what if we have been off line?

1. match rows and columns; if we have deleted column we still delete that. if we have inserted column same. a move is a delete and reinsert, here though we would need to transform the position to insert at a rational spot.
