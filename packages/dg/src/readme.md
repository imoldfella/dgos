alternate syntax

class Art {
    name = ""
    age = 0
}
const art = new Art
primary(art.name)


How should we share something like a spreadsheet across branches?
Copying it seems like the best approach, with some history to allow resyncing.
Linking is an option as long as everyone has access to both.

unique keys are generated similar to bayou
0: gsn
1: device.lsn 

The device is registered in the device table. The device is registered when it first connects to the database. The number of devices per database is fixed at 4 billion (just 4 billion of your closest friends!). The lsn is allowed to wrap around, a device can only create 4 bln transactions offline before connecting. If a device falls off anyone's epoch, it will need to erase the database and start again (you are >4bln transactions behind, so probably a good idea anyway)


The advantage of this system is that we can use a single 64 bit number to identify any transaction

txid: number
